    '''
    This function takes a student and a list of course
    It should compute the GPA for the student
    The GPA is the sum(hours of course * grade in course) / sum(hours of course)
    The grades come in the form: 'A+', 'A' and so on.
    But you can convert the grades to points using a static method in the course class
    To know how to use the Student and Course classes, see the file "college.py"
